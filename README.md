# Check-Subset
One of HakerRank Problem

To Do : 
You are given two sets A and B.
Your job is to find whether set A is a subset of set B.

If set A is subset of set , print True.
If set B is not a subset of set , print False.

Solution :
-Get total number of Test Cases.
-Get set A and set B for each test case.
-Provide the Bool result for each test case for being subset(True) or not(False).
